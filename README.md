# programmingForDataAnalysisAssignment
This is the repo for my Programming for Data Analysis practical assignment. The assignment covers several aspects of the numpy.random package: an overview of the use and function of the packge, descriptions of the "simple random data" and "permutations" functions, more detailed explorations of six probability distribution functions (normal, uniform, poisson, binomial, multinomial, and exponential), and a description of the use of seeds in random data generation.
The assignment consists of the Jupyter notebook contained in this repo. The notebook does not contain any interactive elements or require any action from the reader, beyond simply clicking into the notebook.
